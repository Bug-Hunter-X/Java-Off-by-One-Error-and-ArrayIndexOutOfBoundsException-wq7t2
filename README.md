This repository demonstrates a common Java programming error: an off-by-one error in array indexing, leading to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  The `BuggyCode.java` file contains the erroneous code, while `CorrectedCode.java` provides the solution. The error arises from an incorrect loop condition in the `main` method, causing the loop to iterate one time too many and attempting to access an index outside of the array's bounds.
